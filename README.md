Description:
1. A bilingual (English/French) GUI Battleship game.
2. There are five ships available: an aircraft carrier, a battleship, a submarine, a cruise, and a destroyer.
3. It features 2 computer levels, simple and intelligent, where the simple mode randomly chooses the spot for the strike, and the intelligent mode follows patterns to find the ships as fast as possible (the hunter mode).
4. When the computer hits the ship, it tries to determine its position and sink it (the killer mode).
5. The scores for the game are saved to the file to save wins and losses for the specific player.
